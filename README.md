# ES4 Digital Electronics Final Project - smash_buds

This project was developed for ES-4, Digital Logic Circuits, at Tufts University.

This project is a Super Smash Bro's inspired king of the hill game built exclusively through sequential logic in VHDL. Play as Tufts President Tony ROMico or President Elect Sunil Kumar as they compete to rule the Tufts hill. We used two NES controllers for input, and displayed output to 640x480 VGA. Code was written in Radiant and programmed to iCE40UP5k-SG48I FPGA
